# Tech Dash

## Overview

The _Tech Dash_ is the name I call the series of study sessions I created for myself to study particular technical subjects. You could think of them as _sprints_ in the context of _Scrum_.

I create these sessions because sometimes I encounter a technical subject that either I think deserves a review or I'm not familiar enough with but don't have enough time to study in depth due to other constraints, such as a project deadline. Therefore, I'll put the subject into a backlog and come back in the next _tech dash_.

My _tech dashes_ are usually held over the weekends or during a vacation. They are listed below in the reverse chronological order.

## Tech Dash: Christmas 2020 / New Year 2021

The approaching Christmas 2020 may be a good opportunity to spend some time looking at various technical topics I've been wanting to learn or refresh my memory for a while. The COVID-19 pandemic is still going on anyway, so there is few places (or people) I can visit. I don't plan to look deep into each topic but to learn "just enough for now", because each topic itself may need a whole book to discuss.

Here is the list:

- [x] Python
  - [x] `BrokenPipeError`
  - [x] Python: see what modules are available for use now.
- [x] Security
  - [x] `AppArmor` on Ubuntu
  - [x] [TLS SNI](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-sni/)
  - [x] LDAP
- [x] Network
  - [x] Read: _Mastering Linux Network Administration_.
- [x] Linode: Learn about what `Linode` is.
