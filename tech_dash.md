# Tech Dash

## Overview

The _Tech Dash_ is the name I call the series of study sessions I created for myself to study particular technical subjects. You could think of them as _sprints_ in the context of _Scrum_.

I create these sessions because sometimes I encounter a technical subject that either I think deserves a review or I'm not familiar enough with but don't have enough time to study in depth due to other constraints, such as a project deadline. Therefore, I'll put the subject into a backlog and come back in the next _tech dash_.

The subjects to study come from two primary sources: my work and my intention to learn about the current development in the industry. See the section `Up-To-Date` to see the links I'm following.

My _tech dashes_ are usually held over the weekends or during a vacation. They are listed below in the reverse chronological order.

## Up-To-Date

Listing a ton of sources is easy. Following up is difficult. Understanding is even harder.

I think listing the resources, even after reading them, is essentially the same as bookmarking them but never coming back. One can't expect the knowledge is learned by listing them. One must create his/her own knowledge base and integrate the new knowledge into the base.

My current knowledge base project is [robin_on_rails](https://github.com/yaobinwen/robin_on_rails).

I am following the development in the following areas:

- Linux kernel: So that I know the new capabilities that the OS can provide.
- Networking.
- Security.
- Virtualization.
- Container & orchestration.

Below is the list of sources I am using (incomplete as of 2021-01-23):

- [Brendan D. Gregg](http://www.brendangregg.com/): Author of the books: "Systems Performance: Enterprise and the Cloud" and "BPF Performance Tools".
- [酷壳](https://coolshell.cn/)
- [四火的唠叨](https://www.raychase.net/)
- [科技爱好者周刊](https://github.com/ruanyf/weekly): 记录每周值得分享的科技内容 (by 阮一峰)
- [Technology Short Take](https://blog.scottlowe.org/) by Scott Lowe.
- Linux kernel development:
  - [linux.com](https://www.linux.com/): "Linux.com is the go-to resource for open source professionals to learn about the latest in Linux and open source technology, careers, best practices, and industry trends."
    - To see the articles for a particular topic or audience, use the `TOPIC` and `AUDIENCE` drop lists.

## Tech Dash: 2021-01-23 Weekend

During this weekend, I studied three subjects: virtual ethernet; network namespace; Docker networking. I read the following articles:

- [x] [veth(4)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/veth.4.html)
- [x] [Introduction to Linux interfaces for virtual networking](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2018/10/22/introduction-to-linux-interfaces-for-virtual-networking/)
- [x] [network_namespace(7)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/network_namespaces.7.html)
- [x] [Introducing Linux Network Namespaces](https://blog.scottlowe.org/2013/09/04/introducing-linux-network-namespaces/)
- [x] https://github.com/moby/libnetwork/blob/master/docs/design.md
- [x] [The Container Networking Landscape: CNI from CoreOS and CNM from Docker](https://thenewstack.io/container-networking-landscape-cni-coreos-cnm-docker/)
- [x] [Understanding Docker Networking Drivers and their use cases](https://www.docker.com/blog/understanding-docker-networking-drivers-use-cases/)

I planned to read more, but I didn't find enough time to finish reading all of them. Besides, I realized I couldn't just read the articles. I must make notes in order to integrate what I've read into my knowledge base. I'll need several follow-up Tech Dash sessions to finish that.

## Tech Dash: Christmas 2020 / New Year 2021

The approaching Christmas 2020 may be a good opportunity to spend some time looking at various technical topics I've been wanting to learn or refresh my memory for a while. The COVID-19 pandemic is still going on anyway, so there is few places (or people) I can visit. I don't plan to look deep into each topic but to learn "just enough for now", because each topic itself may need a whole book to discuss.

Here is the list:

- [x] Python
  - [x] `BrokenPipeError`
  - [x] Python: see what modules are available for use now.
- [x] Security
  - [x] `AppArmor` on Ubuntu
  - [x] [TLS SNI](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-sni/)
  - [x] LDAP
- [x] Network
  - [x] Read: _Mastering Linux Network Administration_.
- [x] Linode: Learn about what `Linode` is.
