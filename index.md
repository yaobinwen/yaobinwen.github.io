## Education

- [Life Club](https://lifeclub.org/) focuses on delivering life skills that work for people in the modern societies. Frankly speaking, I don't know how well they do yet (as of 2020-12-29) because I haven't read much of their writing. But their goals align with mine in the way that I also think the current school curriculum is out-dated and we need to deliver a new set of courses that help develop a person to a better extent.
