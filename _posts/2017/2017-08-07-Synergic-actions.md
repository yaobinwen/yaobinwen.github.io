title: Synergic Actions &colon; Make the Best Use of Your Daily Life And Work
---

> When you are working on a goal, make sure all your actions cooperate with and strengthen, rather than conflict with and thus weaken, each other, to produce a greater power than doing them separately.

I learned the concept "synergic actions" when reading a reply by Professor-Li on [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/).

The idea is as mentioned above: **When you are working on a goal, make sure all your actions cooperate with and strengthen, rather than conflict with and thus weaken, each other, to produce a greater power than doing them separately.**

This morning when I was reading another book, [Study Wisely](https://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Personal-Knowledge-Management-Chinese/dp/7508671589), the author, Cheng Jia, says "The best source of learning material is our everyday life".

What an obvious yet provocative insight! I've lived through my life so long but have not thought too much about it! Then I asked myself: Why could he find out this simple and effective idea but I just kept overlooking it in the past 30 more years? That's when "synergic actions" occurred to me and I realize this is an immediate application of this concept.

Here is the reasoning:

- I want to keep learning to improve my decision quality by evaluating my decision-making process. To do this, I need a lot of raw material for analysis.
- In my daily life, I make a lot of decisions.
- Now let's apply the "synergic actions" thinking model: When I combine them together, I can maximize my time usage because I don't need to spend additional time looking for other material.

"Synergic actions" is a very good model of organizing the daily activities: Set up the goals, set up the action plan, and make sure all the activities enhance each other to produce a more powerful result.
