## Key takeaways

I'll be straightforward: The key takeaways of the book [_Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18770267-make-it-stick) about effective learning are as follows.

- 1). **Active retrieval** improves knowledge and retention. **Do not** simply re-read the notes.
- 2). **Study repeatedly** to reinforce memories. Also refer to [Hermann Ebbinghaus's _forgetting curve_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve) for why spaced repetition is helpful.
- 3). **Mix different topics or problem types** during study sessions. For example, in one study session:
  - If the learner is studying history, he/she can mix the multiple historical periods such as Renaissance and Industrial Revolution.
  - If the learner is studying math, he/she can mix algebra, geometry, and trigonometry.
- 4). **Learning with an effort** improves the effectiveness.
  - For example, when discussing a mathematical theorem, instead of showing the proof directly, let the learner prove the theorem by him-/herself. The learner may have to think hard and make a few failing attempts until he/she succeeds (or not). The point is the learner is fully engaged into the question. The mistakes that are made provide the learner a fuller view of the problem.
- 5). Use **"generative" methods** to improve learning. For example:
  - **Elaboration**: Describing a key idea in one's own words. Explain an idea to the people outside the domain (e.g., grandma) and let them understand the idea.
  - **Generation**: Generate examples, analogies or metaphors for an idea. For example, if one says he/she is familiar with design patterns, what are the real-life examples of the patterns?
- 6). **Reflect** on what have been learned and the reasons that the mistakes have been made.
- 7). **Use tests** to evaluate the abilities (i.e., the learning results) more objectively.

## Actions to take on future learning

When planning a study session, try to find different topics/subjects to work on. This activity is based on `3)` "mix different topics".

When taking notes, instead of simply copying the textbook contents to the notebook in the same order as the textbook, **summarize the learning material and re-organize the key points in the way that shows the internal linkage among the key points.** The activity is based on `4)` "learning with an effort" and `5)` "elaboration".

When taking notes, also **generate review questions** that help the learner to use as a "pop quiz" next time he/she comes back to the learning material. The learner can try to answer these review questions before reviewing the notes to test how much he/she has matered the material. This activity is based on `1)` "active retrieval", `4)` "learning with an effort", `5)` "generation", and `6)` "use tests".

When generating the review questions, **try to use "fill-in-the-blank" type of questions** instead of multiple-choice type, because "fill-in-the-blank" provides the minimum amount of information in the question description and forces the learner to maximize the active retrieval in order to answer the questions. This activity is based on `1)` "active retrieval".

After finishing one study session, **schedule future study sessions of the same topic** in order to reinforce memories because studying the material only once is not necessary to make it stick. This activity is based on `2)` "study repeatedly". For example:

| Session | Time |
|--------:|:-----|
| Initial | 0 |
| 2nd | 2 days later |
| 3rd | 7 days later |
| 4th | 30 days later |
| 5th | 180 days later |
