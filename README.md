## Blog Theme

I'm using [_The Hacker theme_](https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker).

## Build & Serve

Run `./build-serve.sh` to build the site and serve locally.

Notes:
- 1. I'm building my own `ruby` Docker images in order to build and serve locally for local development.
- 2. The script `build-serve.sh` does everything: build the customized Docker image and run `jekyll serve` appropriately.
